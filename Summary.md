# SUMMARY TEMPLATE
Answer all the questions. Please put your answers *after* the italicized instructions.

## Scoring System Rationale  
*Explain how you decided on the point values for each criterion in your `HousingPriorityCalculator` class. Why these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Be specific about your point values for:*
- *Class year (freshman vs senior)*
- *Graduation status*  
- *Credits earned*
- *Additional questions (e.g., age, honors status)*

[10 points]

## Object-Oriented Design Reflection
*Reflect on the experience of separating functionality into two classes (`HousingQuestionAsker` and `HousingPriorityCalculator`). What are the benefits of this approach compared to having all functions in one file? What challenges did you encounter when coordinating between the classes?*

## Citations
### Who did you work with and how?  
*Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you don't share code.*  
*Please include any people or other sources who helped you, and any students whom you helped.*  
*For each source, make sure to include how they helped you (or how you helped them).*

* *"I had no idea how to approach Question 3 until classmate Alice Smith explained how I could break it down into separate functions."*  
* *"I showed Bob Lee my test-mocking approach for calculate_score; he gave me feedback on ordering the decorators."*  
* *If you did not talk to anybody about the assignment, please state that.*

### What was your AI usage?  
*State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do not answer this question.*

* *"I used ChatGPT to brainstorm additional yes/no questions; prompt: 'Suggest two easy yes/no criteria for housing priority.'"*

### What resources did you use?  
*Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which ones were particularly helpful.*

* *https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html – for learning about `unittest.mock.patch`.*  
* *https://realpython.com/python-mock-library/ – example patterns for mocking user input.*

## Testing Strategy
*Describe your approach to testing the different components:*
- *How did you test the `HousingQuestionAsker` class methods?*
- *What edge cases did you consider for the `HousingPriorityCalculator` class?*
- *How did you use `@patch.object()` in your integration tests?*

## Logistics
### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?  
*Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass. Be specific about any methods or test cases that are incomplete.*

### How long did the assignment take?  
*Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range. Break down time spent on different parts (implementation, testing, debugging).*

## Reflections  
*Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the assignment, including answers to all of these questions:*  
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?  
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?  
* What did you learn about object-oriented programming from this assignment?
* How did separating concerns into different classes affect your development process?
